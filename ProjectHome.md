This project is a library for using the Sharp Memory LCD with an Arduino. The Sharp Memory LCD is a ultra low power (6uW) very high contrast display. It is available at [mouser.com](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Sharp-Microelectronics/LS013B4DN02/?qs=3olo1ghYtVTpUL4ihCnvwITK7SIApOhgtCHiJm7UiOOkb4wQpHEgpw%3d%3d) among other outlets. Go to [Sharp to view the datasheet](http://www.sharpmemorylcd.com/1-35-inch-memory-lcd.html).

This library extends the [Adafruit-GFX-Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library). You must have it installed for this library to work.

I've included Eagle files for the breakout board in the video above. You can download the attached SharpLCD\_Eagle.zip file which includes "gerber" files that can be used to make the PCBs. I used OSHPark.com to have them made. I think 3 were about $6 or $10.

The library is updated occasionally but I do not always update the attached source zip file. You are advised to download the source with git if you want the latest version.
