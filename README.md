This project is a library for using the Sharp Memory LCD with an Arduino. The Sharp Memory LCD is a ultra low power (6uW) very high contrast display. It is available at mouser.com among other outlets. Go to Sharp to view the datasheet.

This library extends the Adafruit-GFX-Library. You must have it installed for this library to work.

I've included Eagle files for the breakout board in the video above. You can download the attached SharpLCD_Eagle.zip file which includes "gerber" files that can be used to make the PCBs. I used OSHPark.com to have them made. I think 3 were about $6 or $10.

The library is updated occasionally but I do not always update the attached source zip file. You are advised to download the source with git if you want the latest version.
